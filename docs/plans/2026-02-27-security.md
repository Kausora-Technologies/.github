# SECURITY.md Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Create a minimal `SECURITY.md` at the repo root documenting Kausora Technologies' responsible disclosure policy.

**Architecture:** Single markdown file at the repo root. Three sections: how to report, what to include, what to expect. No version table, no PGP.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown

### Task 1: Write SECURITY.md

**Files:**
- Create: `SECURITY.md`

**Step 1: Create the file with exactly this content**
