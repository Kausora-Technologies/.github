# SECURITY.md Design

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Approved

## Purpose

Add a `SECURITY.md` to the Kausora Technologies `.github` repo so it serves as the org-wide default responsible disclosure policy for all repositories.

## Approach

Option A — Minimal. Three sections, no version table, no PGP.

## Structure

1. **Reporting a Vulnerability** — email `contact@kausora.com` privately; do not open a public issue
2. **What to Include** — description, steps to reproduce, affected repo/version, impact assessment
3. **What to Expect** — acknowledgement of receipt, investigation, no fixed timeline, notification when resolved

## Conventions

- Contact: `contact@kausora.com`
- No PGP key
- No fixed disclosure timeline
- Tone: direct and minimal, consistent with CONTRIBUTING.md style
