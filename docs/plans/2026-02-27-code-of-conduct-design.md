# CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md Design

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Approved

## Purpose

Add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to the Kausora Technologies `.github` repo so it serves as the org-wide default for all repositories.

## Approach

Adopt Contributor Covenant v2.1 verbatim with minimal customization.

## Structure

1. **Security note (top)** — Short redirect before the pledge: security vulnerabilities should not be reported publicly; see `SECURITY.md` instead.
2. **Contributor Covenant v2.1** — Full canonical text, verbatim.

## Customizations

| Placeholder | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` (reporting) | `conduct@kausora.com` |
| `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` (enforcement) | `conduct@kausora.com` |
| "community leaders" / "project maintainers" references in enforcement sections | "Kausora Community Moderation Team" |

## Security Note Text

> **Security vulnerabilities:** If you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure instructions.

## Tone

Formal and neutral — matching the CC v2.1 standard. Security note is brief and non-alarming.
