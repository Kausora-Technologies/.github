# README.md Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Replace the placeholder `README.md` with a functional, developer-facing document explaining this repo's purpose and how GitHub applies its files org-wide.

**Architecture:** Single markdown file at the repo root. Overwrites the existing one-line placeholder. Five sections: heading, what's included, how GitHub applies defaults, proposing changes, org overview link.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown

### Task 1: Write README.md

**Files:**
- Modify: `README.md`

**Step 1: Replace the file with exactly this content**

```markdown
# Kausora Technologies — .github

Org-wide community health defaults for Kausora Technologies.

## What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) | Community standards and enforcement |
| [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Contribution workflow and conventions |
| [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) | Responsible disclosure policy |

## How GitHub Applies These

Files in this repository serve as defaults for all Kausora Technologies repositories that do not supply their own. If a repository contains its own copy of any of these files, that copy takes precedence over the one here.

## Proposing Changes

Open a pull request against `main`. Note that changes to files in this repository can affect every Kausora Technologies repository that has not overridden that file — review carefully before merging.

## Org Overview

For a public overview of Kausora Technologies, see [`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md).
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "[DOCS] Add org-wide README.md"
```
