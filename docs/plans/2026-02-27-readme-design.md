# README.md Design

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Approved

## Purpose

Replace the placeholder `README.md` (currently just `# .github`) with a functional, developer-facing document explaining what this repo is and how it works.

## Audience

Developers and contributors — internal and external.

## Structure

1. **Heading + one-liner** — `# Kausora Technologies — .github` / "Org-wide community health defaults for Kausora Technologies."
2. **What's Included** — table: file name + one-line description for CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md
3. **How GitHub Applies These** — 2–3 sentences: files here serve as org-wide defaults; repos without their own copy inherit these; repos can override by adding their own
4. **Proposing Changes** — open a PR; warn that changes affect every repo in the org that hasn't overridden the file
5. **Org Overview** — one line linking to `profile/README.md`

## Tone

Developer-facing, concise. Same register as CONTRIBUTING.md — no filler, direct.
